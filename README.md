# Admin Dashboard
## Description
This goal of this web app was to create a mock website dashboard. The mock design was obtained from The Odin Project and the website was made to closely resemble it. This project was a valuable learning experience that taught me how to integrate both CSS grid and flexbox into one website and has helped me think about how to organize CSS files.
